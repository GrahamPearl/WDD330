          <h3>Rules to assess Sources by</h3>   
          <p><i>The following guidelines should be considered as academic and industrial practices</i></p>       
          <ul>
          <li><i>Citation / Scholarism</i>: Academic writings are professionally reviewed. Citation counts and the 
            quality of professional review indicates a level of academic reputation that a source has. Google Scholar 
            uses this for the ranking of the publications that are available for reference. Ensure that the citation is 
            applied on time appropriate and topic applyable content. Use highly rated professional journals and communities 
            publications prior to lesser quality resources</li>
          <li><i>Material Type / Longivity</i>: Textbooks are generally acceptable content as the publisher needs to
          employ their own assessment standards to the quality of the sources. This can result in a source or solution being 
          out-of-date due to the rapid uptake of technology. Keep a few 'hard'-printed copies of core knowledge areas to reference.</li>
          <li><i>Video / PluralSight</i>: Subscription services on a knowledge base are more reliable due to their interest in retaining 
          clientele that are satisfied with the quality. Ensure that the content of unmediated content is considered in line with company 
          produced content (Youtube: Amazon / Microsoft) prior to random consumer produced content (Youtube: Mr Jones)</li>
          <li><i>Experts (Professional Bodies)</i>: A measure of the quality that a professional qualified individual or community 
          has in life is assessable by the certification in a specific field of science. As the professional community will contribute
          towards maintaining their own core knowledge, rankings from other recognized professionals allows the identification of expert knowledge.
          Stack-Overflow applies a rating system by which solutions submitted can be uprated by others. This improves the measure of
          professionalism associated to that individual or community. Check always the number of votes and divide this by the time between posting on the topic</li>
          <li><i>Prove / Test / Insured Knowledge</i>: Test cases that allow for confidence to by self-exploration and review to confirm a source
          or outcome is significantly more trustworthy. If the conditions are unable to be replicated, then the process of confirmation is limited.
          Identify actionable items/tasks that can be performed to confirm the validity of statements.</li>
